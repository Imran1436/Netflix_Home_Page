# Netflix_Home_Page

The Netflix Home Page Clone project involves creating a visually appealing and functional replica of Netflix's home page using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in front-end development by replicating the core layout, design, and some interactive features found on the actual Netflix platform.
